# Opero

Opero is Latin for 'I work', and it's built in the hopes of relieving some of the stress of searching for a job by aggregating all of the jobs from every employment site that has a public API.

I wrote ~90% of the code for as part of a project in a web programming course, was a good learning experience. 

It's fairly WYSIWYG inasmuch as a job seeker enters a query, and the engine spits out a list of results according to the job seeker's needs with regards to location, salary, and job keyword(s).  

The results page isn't functioning as the API and workflow interactivity is limited due to my removal of some of the mySQL verification and Oath key codes which are (obviously) private and reserved for individual members of the site to employ (ha).  

I'll eventually update it with more API's, but for now it's a work in progress.
